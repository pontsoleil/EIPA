<!-- Sample detailed listing of employee time sheet file for XBRL Global Ledger Framework with annotations  Version 1.0.91021.1 -->
<!-- This file contains data fields considered very important to representing its subject. Annotations have been provided for the "most important" of those fields. XBRL GL has many other fields that could be helpful in expressing the information, but have been omitted because their presence is more circumstantial. This file was created for educational purposes only, does not represent real company data and we welcome suggestions on improvement. Contact xbrlgl@xbrl.org with comments. -->
<!-- This file shows how we might represent timecards with XBRL GL. Another set of standards, from HR-XML, may be better suited for this purpose depending on the circumstances. See http://ns.hr-xml.org/2_3/HR-XML-2_3/TimeCard/TimeCard.html. Timecards carry time and expenses but are pre-discovery of monetary amounts associated with the hour lines.-->

	<!-- The container for XBRL GL, accountingEntries, is not the root of an XBRL GL file - the root, as with all XBRL files, is xbrl. This means that a single XBRL GL file can store one or more virtual XBRL GL files, through one or more accountingEntries structures with data inside. The primary key to understanding an XBRL GL file is the entriesType. A single physical XBRL GL file can have multiple accountingEntries structures to represent both transactions and master files; the differences are signified by the appropriate entriesType enumerated values. This is especially important in a representation of this kind. A file creator can create a single physical file but have information about the employees in one accountingEntries section and in information about the time sheets in another referencing only the employee number, thereby reducing the duplicated information (employee name, address, etc.) in the file resulting in smaller file sizes -->

			<!-- As noted, when illustrating details on a form/document, individual line are represented using entryDetail which must be held together by entryHeaders - one primary amount per entryDetail line. However, you can list different accounts within the same entryDetail line that are associated with that amount. For example, if you capitalize payroll related to research for US GAAP and expense for IFRS, you can have multiple account structures within one entryDetail section. The generic nature of XBRL GL means that much of the  information that is common to each line, such as the employee, or the document attributes, must be repeated on each detail line, or be entered into one of the lines with an understanding that it is common to all.

Duration is gl-bus:measurableQuantity and gl-bus:measurableUnitOfMeasure
Task is PROBABLY gl-bus:measurableQualifier, although the result is better there; it could go in a comment field or other places as well.
Project is either a subAccount or represented by jobInfo; we will use the jobCode here.
Cost Center is associated with a subAccount
Billable is gl-bus:documentChargeReimb
