XBRL GL has a number of tools for representing jobs and their details:
1. There is an accountType of job (enumerated), so jobs with phases and cost codes can be represented by the account structure explicitly.
2. Even if you use accountType of account (enumerated), you can still use the accountSub and have accountSubType with (nonenumerated) job, phase, cost code.
3. And alternative to the account structure, you can use the jobInfo structure, which has a jobCode/jobDescription and jobPhaseCode/jobPhaseDescription.

XBRL GL also has a number of tools for representing budgets:
1. An entry can be related to a budget by the enumeration of budget for entryType.
2. The budgetScenario/budgetScenarioText, with the associated budgetScenarioPeriodStart and budgetScenarioPeriodEnd, describes the budget(s) involved - you can have the original budget (for a job, in this example), a revised budget, a worst case budget, etc.

In our example above, the job information could be represented

1. Within an account structure, with accountType of "job". The  
				<gl-cor:account>
					<gl-cor:accountMainID contextRef="now">05-08SAMEPL</gl-cor:accountMainID>
					<gl-cor:accountMainDescription contextRef="now">Old Same Place Division, Lot 103, New Old Post Road</gl-cor:accountMainDescription>
					<gl-cor:accountType contextRef="now">job</gl-cor:accountType>
				</gl-cor:account>
				
Phases and cost codes would be subAccount structures
This would be helpful where a job is also an account on the balance sheet.

2. Within an account structure, with accountType of "job", in the accountSub structure.
				<gl-cor:account>
					<gl-cor:accountType contextRef="now">job</gl-cor:accountType>
					<gl-cor:accountSub>
						<gl-cor:accountSubDescription contextRef="now">Old Same Place Division, Lot 103, New Old Post Road</gl-cor:accountSubDescription>
						<gl-cor:accountSubID contextRef="now">05-08SAMEPL</gl-cor:accountSubID>
						<gl-cor:accountSubType contextRef="now">job</gl-cor:accountSubType>
					</gl-cor:accountSub>
				</gl-cor:account>
Phases and cost codes would be additional subAccount structures
Approach 2 and 3 are especially helpful where analysis by job/phase/cost code will be done from the chart of accounts.

3. Within an account structure, with accountType of "account", in the accountSub structure. The
				<gl-cor:account>
					<gl-cor:accountType contextRef="now">account</gl-cor:accountType>
					<gl-cor:accountSub>
						<gl-cor:accountSubDescription contextRef="now">Old Same Place Division, Lot 103, New Old Post Road</gl-cor:accountSubDescription>
						<gl-cor:accountSubID contextRef="now">05-08SAMEPL</gl-cor:accountSubID>
						<gl-cor:accountSubType contextRef="now">job</gl-cor:accountSubType>
					</gl-cor:accountSub>
				</gl-cor:account>
Phases and cost codes would be subAccount structures

4. In the jobInfo structure. The
jobCode: 05-08SAMEPL
jobDescription: Old Same Place Division, Lot 103, New Old Post Road
Phases would also be in the jobInfo structure, but cost codes under current XBRL GL design would be subAccount structures in an account structure.

Perhaps simplest and parallels many accounting systems.

Are so many possibilities confusing? Sure - but accounting systems store them in all these different formats and more. As long as an application developer knows that there are a limited number of options, they can plan for it.

		<!-- A concept found in the entryHeader is the entryType. This is enumerated, with values that include "budget" and "standard."

The original and revised budgets will be shown using budgetScenario and budgetScenarioText -->
