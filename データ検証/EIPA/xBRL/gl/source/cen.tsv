When specifying the textual value, which is commonly the invoice number of the invoice being paid, but may be another seller reference, the buyer should indicate this reference in his payment order when executing the payment. In a payment transaction this reference is transferred back to the Seller as Remittance Information. In order to allow for automatic processing of cross-border SEPA payments, only Latin characters should be used in this field, with a maximum of 140 characters. Reference section 1.4 of the SEPA credit transfer and SEPA direct debit scheme implementation guides [13] and [14] for details of the allowed characters. Other rules may apply for SEPA payments within national borders. If remittance information is structured according to the ISO 11649:2009 standard [16] for Structured RF Creditor Reference, it shall be mapped to the Structured Remittance Information Creditor Reference field in SEPA payments messages. If remittance information is structured according to the EACT standard for automated reconciliation [17], it shall be mapped to the Unstructured Remittance Information field in SEPA payments messages.' If remittance information is to be mapped to the End To End Identification field or to the Structured Remittance Information Creditor Reference field in SEPA payments messages, then in addition to the Latin character set restriction, the content shall not start or end with a '/' and the content shall not contain '//'s.
