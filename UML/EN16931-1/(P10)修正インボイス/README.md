Many cases exist where an invoice is disputed and/or may need to be corrected. Product descriptions may be wrong, invoiced quantities may differ from delivered quantities, VAT rates may have changed, etc.  
A disputed invoice may be corrected by means of the following mechanisms:  
1. the disputed invoice may be replaced completely by first sending an identical credit note or an invoice in which the quantities and thus the line and total amounts have been made negative and then sending the correct invoice
2. alternatively an invoice, credit note or negative invoice may be sent with the difference in quantities and amounts between the correct invoice and the disputed invoice. Such a differential corrective invoice or credit note may contain lines that completely compensate lines in the disputed invoice with the corrected lines.
Corrective invoices and credit notes shall refer to the original invoice.  
See Annex A for examples of these correction mechanisms.
