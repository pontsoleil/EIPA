In the case of reimbursement of packaging material or returns, the total amount to be invoiced may be negative. In this case a credit note with a positive total amount may be sent instead of an invoice. The Seller will reimburse the Buyer, either by means of a negative invoice or by means of a credit note. The invoice or credit note may refer to one delivery, one purchase order, one contract and one preceding invoice.  
On the basis of a commercial agreement the Seller may apply a quarterly or yearly reimbursement (not shown in the diagram). A credit note may also be used in such case.
