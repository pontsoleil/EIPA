The Buyer purchases goods and services without any prior purchase order or contract (e.g. by ordering over the telephone, internet or over the counter). Payment is made in advance of the invoice, e.g. by means of a credit, debit or payment card or through a payment service provider. Note that sufficient business controls should be present in the administrations of both parties given the absence of written purchase orders. Invoicing may take place before, after or at the same time as the delivery. The invoice refers to the account or card number used for payment and states the amount paid in advance. An invoice may only refer to one delivery.
