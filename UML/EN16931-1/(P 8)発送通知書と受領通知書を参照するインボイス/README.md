After delivery and before the invoice is issued, the Seller waits for a receiving advice from the Receiver, in which the Receiver acknowledges that the goods and services have been received and if there are any issues with the delivery. The Seller bases the invoice on information contained in the receiving advice. The invoice may refer to one despatch advice, one receiving advice and may also refer to only one purchase order.
