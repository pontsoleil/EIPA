In a self-billing process, the Buyer sends the invoice to the Seller. Both Buyer and Seller keep their responsibilities, so the invoice is still issued on behalf of the Seller. According to directive 2006/112/EC, the invoice shall be labelled as being a self-billed invoice and the requirements mentioned in article 224 of this directive shall be met. Self-billing may be introduced only if there is a prior agreement between the two parties and provided that a procedure exists for the acceptance of each invoice by the taxable person supplying the goods or services.  
In case of self-billing, the Invoice type code shall be Self-billed invoice or Self-billed credit note. In this case the buyer will have legal responsibility for the invoice.
