In this process the contract directly triggers the delivery. There is no requirement for a purchase order. This scenario is common in the delivery of utilities, but also in delivery of, e.g. food services to offices, schools and hospitals. Invoices are issued to cover a fixed period of time (which can be different per invoice line) and there are continuously instances of the goods and service being delivered. An invoice may only refer to one contract.
