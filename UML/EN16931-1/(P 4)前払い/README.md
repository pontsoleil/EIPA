The Buyer orders goods and services. Full payment or part-payment is made in advance of the invoice. The invoice states the amount paid in advance and the amount now due for payment by deducting the amount paid in advance from the invoice total, i.e. the balance. If the balance is positive, there is still an amount of money outstanding to the Seller and a final payment is made. If the balance is negative, an invoice with a negative amount due for payment is sent, or a credit note. The Seller then pays the balance to the Buyer. Each delivery results in an invoice. An invoice may only refer to one delivery and one purchase order.
