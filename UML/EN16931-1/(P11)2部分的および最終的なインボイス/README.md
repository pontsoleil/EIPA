In some industries, such as Construction and Utilities, during the period of delivery one or more partial invoices are sent before the final invoice. Partial invoices may be estimates of consumption or requests for pre-payment. In some cases, the pre-payment requests do not state the VAT amounts; those are then only stated on the final invoice.  
The final invoice shall refer to the partial invoices.  
Note that partial invoices without VAT are not allowed in some member states.
